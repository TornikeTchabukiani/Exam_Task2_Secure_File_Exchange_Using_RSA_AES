Dear Bob,

This is a highly confidential message that demonstrates hybrid encryption.
We are using RSA to secure the AES key, and AES to encrypt this message.

This approach combines:
- RSA's strength for key exchange (asymmetric)
- AES's efficiency for data encryption (symmetric)

The message is signed with integrity verification using SHA-256.

Best regards,
Alice
